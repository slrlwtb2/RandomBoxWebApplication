**Website Overview**
-

Enter the website ----> [HERE](https://slrlwtb2.github.io/RandomBoxWebApplication/) **The website is not available (My Azure student plan is out of credits).
I've updated the API's URL address, but it's still using HTTP instead of HTTPS. If you'd like to try out this project, you can clone the repository and run it â€“ it should still work perfectly fine.**
  
**How to use the demo website:**  
This website serves as an Front-end(using JavaScript) to fetch this API  : [RandomBoxAPI](https://github.com/slrlwtb2/RandomBoxAPI)

- Register and Login in to website
- Buy a box and find it in your profile's Inventory.  
- Open the box to experience the application's flow.  
- Increase your balance by selling the items inside your inventory.
-  The default balance is 300 credits.  

**Here are the default User Accounts:**  
Admin User: (Username: Admin) (Password: ADMIN)  
Authorized User: (Username: User) (Password: User)  
  
Feel free to create new accounts as needed! Just log in using the login button.  
CRUD functionalities, including for the Admin user, have been disabled to *prevent misuse*.  
  

## Enjoy using the website and have fun exploring its features!
